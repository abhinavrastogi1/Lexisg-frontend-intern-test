## ðŸ§ª Simulated API Behavior

This app simulates a backend API response. Regardless of the query entered, the same answer and citation are returned for demonstration purposes.

This behavior mimics how a real legal assistant .

The simulated response looks like this:

```js
const simulatedResponse = {
  answer:
    "Yes, under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the claimants are entitled to an addition for future prospects even when the deceased was self-employed and aged 54â€“55 years at the time of the accident...",
  citations: [
    {
      text: "as the age of the deceased at the time of accident was held to be about 54-55 years...",
      source: "Pritam_Singh.pdf",
      link: "https://lexisingapore-my.sharepoint.com/...pdf",
      paragraph: "Para 7",
    },
  ],
};
```
